Play the game!
Click on any tile you would like and try to find its match. The game will begin to record the number of moves you make to try and win, keep track of your time, and rank you with stars depending on 
how many moves you make!
At the end you will be able to see your overall final outcome of how well you played, and have the opportunity to play again!
